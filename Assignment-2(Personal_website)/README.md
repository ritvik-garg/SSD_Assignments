### How to RUN ?
Just open the`index.html` file in `any browser` , and in `any device`.

### Project Structure
The project folder has 3 seperate files for `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`.
All the images used in the website are stored in the folder named `images`.
Likewise, `.css` file is stored under `CSS` folder, and `.js` file is stored under `JS` folder.
There is also one `resources` folder which contains resources which can be downloaded from the website.
There are three different files for 3 pages in the webiste, namely `index.html`, `journey.html`, and `skills.html`.

### Other Details
* Simple HTML, CSS and JS is used in this project.
* Bootstrap is also used to try to add beauty to the site.
* Navigation bar is built at the left side of the page, without using Bootstrap, but with basic HTML.
* `container` class of Bootstrap is used to do proper indentation while displaying the progress bars in the skills sections.
* `progress` class is used for displaying the `active stripped progress bar` in the skill section.   
* `footer` is built at the bottom of each page, which includes logos of social platform sites, like FB, LinkedIn, etc.
* `Download CV` button is provided at the `journey` page, which `on-click` calls `JavaScript function` and open a PDF (PDF is not actual CV, its this assignment.. xD)
* `viewport` meta tag is used to make website's dimensions and scaling, adjust according to the device used.
